/* Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions (and differences in hoisting)
YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjLn95skIKE&list=PLTo9PCskHpbFKsuQjG99YNwFw1XAQgwXR&index=3

JavaScript expressions evaluate to something.
JavaScript declarations

two ways to define functions in JS: 
function declarations get hoisted; they can be called and executed before/above
where they get defined in your codebase

function expressions are functions that are part of a larger functions;
this is what happens when you use a callback or an immediately invoked function;
they do not get hoisted. The variable does, but the function does not.

EXAMPLE 1
will print out the definted function; important to note that you're not calling/invoking
the function here because there are no () after doSomething
next we call doSomething and it will print out what we told it to print out */
console.log(doSomething)
console.log(doSomething())

// Function Declaration
function doSomething() {
  console.log('function declaration; declare something')
}

/* this statement for the Function Expression comes out 'undefined'
because the variable got hoisted, but the program doesn't see anything
in it yet */
console.log(something)

/* and if we try to invoke the function we get a TypeError telling us
'something' is not a function  */
console.log(something())

// Function Expression
let something = function () {
  console.log('function expression; express something')
}

/* Why the TypeError? Because during execution, the JS engine hasn't
    yet gotten to the line where a function is assigned to the variable

Example2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assign a function to the runIt variable; it takes in a parameter */
var runIt = function(a) {
  console.log(a);
  a();
}

// invoke runIt(), with parameter 'a', we put a function in for parameter 'a'
runIt(function() {
  var b = ' Now';
  console.log('Running' + b);
})

/* What should happen?
  runIt() will execute | trying to print out the value accepted as 'a' (line 45).
  That value happens to be a callback function. So runIt() will print out
  a - the callback function (lines 49-52).

  runit() will then immediately invoke this function assigned to 'a' (line 46)
  That is, it will invoke the callback. This callback will print out
  'Running Now' (as you can see in lines 50 & 51) after
  the callback's definition printed out (done on line 45).

  THE OUTPUT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:

  function(){
    var b = ' Now';
    console.log('Running' + b);
  }
  Running Now
